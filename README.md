# Arduino-Joystick
Simple joystick sketch for Arduino Pro Micro


Uses the [Arduino Joystick library by Matthew Heironimus](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary), with slight modifications to the Joystick.cpp to facilitate simplier use case.

Also uses an exponential scale for analog axes.
